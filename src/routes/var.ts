 * @description First things first, this file shouldn't even exist. Blame it on the legacy frontend code. Braindead routing if i ever seen it.
 * Each route in this shithole should just have been in referenceData, but for some reason, they felt like separating it from the rest.
 * And it even uses its own search function, which is just a stinking pile of spaghettified shitðŸ¥°.
 * Is this supposed to be paginated? What the fuck do you send in q? this could have just been a proper attribute query, but nah.
 * Had to make the vaguest query string of all times.
